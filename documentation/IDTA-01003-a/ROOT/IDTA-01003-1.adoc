== Preamble

===  Editorial Notes

The document "Details of the Asset Administration Shell – Part 1 – The exchange of information between partners in the value chain of Industie 4.0, V3.0RC02" was split into several parts. One of them is this document, which represents Part 3a and describes a data specification that is defined to be used with the core model as specified in Part 1. This is also why versioning now starts with V3.0: it is only valid in combination with V3.0 of Part 1.

This document, version 3.0, was produced from June 2022 to November 2022 by the sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the joint working group of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms" and the "Open Technology" working group of the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA). It is the first release published by the IDTA.

For a complete history, please refer to Part 1a of the document series " Details of the Asset Administration Shell".

For better readability, the abbreviation "I4.0" is consistently used for "Industrie 4.0" in compound terms. The term "Industrie 4.0" continues to be used when standing on its own.

This specification is versioned using https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (semver) and follows the semver specification link:#bib13[[13\]].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14[BCP 14] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC2119] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174[RFC8174footnote:[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]]:


. MUST This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
. MUST NOT This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
. SHOULD This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
. MAY This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein, an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)




===  Scope of This Document

The Asset Administration Shell (see Part 1a of the document series) allows to define data specification templates. Data specification templates aim to enable interoperability between the partners that agree on the template. A template defines a set of attributes, with each attribute having a clear semantics. This set of attributes corresponds to a (sub-)schema.

This document specifies data specification templates conformant to IEC 61360. IEC 61360 specifies how to define the semantics of single properties or values. The value range of a property can be defined as a value list – an enumeration -, while each of the (coded) values of the value list are treated as single concepts. They are thus suited to be used as data specifications for concept descriptions.

This document assumes familiarity with the concept and specification of the Asset Administration Shell as defined in Part 1.

The main stakeholders addressed in this document are architects and software developers aiming to implement a digital twin using the Asset Administration Shell in an interoperable way. Additionally, the content can also be used as input for discussions with international standardization organizations and further collaborations.

Please consult the continuously updated reading guide link:#bib15[[15\]] for an overview of documents on the Asset Administration Shell. The reading guide gives advice on which documents should be read depending on the role of the reader.

===  Working Principles

The work is based on the following principle: keep it simple but do not simplify if it affects interoperability.

The partners represented in the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA), as well as in the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and associations such as ZVEI, VDMA, VDI/ VDE and Bitkom, ensure that there is broad sectoral coverage of process, hybrid, and factory automation and in terms of integrating information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT).

Design alternatives were intensively discussed within the working group. An extensive feedback process of this document series is additionally performed within the working groups of Plattform Industrie 4.0 and IDTA.

Guiding principle for the specification was to provide detailed information, which can be easily implemented also by small and medium-sized enterprises.

==  Introduction

This document is part of the series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell" that provide the specifications for interoperable usage of the Asset Administration Shell.

This part of the series extends Part 1 and defines a technology-neutral specification of data specification templates, enabling the description of concept descriptions conformant to IEC 61360 in UML. This UML meta model serves as the basis for deriving several different formats for exchanging Asset Administration Shells, e.g. for XML, JSON, RDF, AutomationML, and OPC UA information models.

_<<#_Toc129706725,Figure 1>>_ shows the different ways of exchanging information via Asset Administration Shells. This part of the "Asset Administration Shell in Detail" series is the basis for all of these types of information exchange.

[#_Toc129706725]
.Types of Information Exchange via Asset Administration Shells
image::image2.jpeg[align=center]

File exchange (1) is described in Part 5 of this document series.

The API (2) is specified in Part 2 of the document series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell" link:#bib14[[14\]]. It also includes access to concept descriptions using the data specifications as specified in this document.

The I4.0 language (3) is based on the information metamodel specified in Part 1 and 3 link:#bib23[[23\]].

Part 3 is not a single document. Instead, it is an own series of documents, each featuring a specific use case that is supported by the specified data specification templates.

== General

=== Introduction

IEC 61360 is a standard that describes how to define the semantics of properties in a data dictionary. The known data dictionaries ECLASS and IEC CDD are based on this standard. The data specification templates specified in this document make it possible to directly use concept descriptions as standardized in these data dictionaries. Additionally, concept descriptions, which do not (yet) exist in these data dictionaries, can be defined using the same schema.

Concept descriptions, whether defined externally in existing data dictionaries or internally as part of the Asset Administration Shell environment, are the foundation for defining submodel templates link:#bib24[[24\]] link:#bib16[[16\]].

IEC 61360-1:2017 is largely compliant to IEC 61360-2:2012 and ISO 3584-42:2010.


====
Note: for details on how to use the data specifications and for further explanations, please refer directly to IEC 61360.
====


The following subclauses show some examples from these existing data dictionaries to ease understanding of the data specification templates.

=== Concept Descriptions for Properties and Values 

The data specification template IEC 61360 introduces additional attributes to define the semantics – i.e. a concept description – of a property or a value based on IEC 61360.

IEC 61360 requests to use IRDIs for the identification of a concept. The Asset Administration Shell allows to use other identifiers besides IRDI. The IRDI, the unique identifier of an IEC 61360 property or value, maps to ConceptDescription/id.

_<<#_Toc129706726,Figure 2>>_ to _<<#_Toc129706729,Figure 5>>_ show examples from ECLASS _<<#_Toc129706727,Figure 3>>_ shows a property with enumeration type. One of the values in this enumeration is shown in _<<#_Toc129706728,Figure 4>>_, each value has its own unique ID. The unique identifier of a value ( _<<#_Toc129706728,Figure 4>>_) is also used for _Property/valueId._

_<<#_Ref129950722,Figure 6>>_ Example for Property with Level Type from IEC CDD shows an example from IEC CDD for a concept description of a _Property_ with usage of Level Type (in this example level type MIN, MAX and NOM, see data type). This is a short form of defining a collection of three properties with the same data type and semantics except for the level.

== Predefined Data Specification Templates 

=== Overview

A data specification template specifies which additional attributes shall be added to an element instance that are not part of the meta model. Typically, data specification templates have a specific scope. For example, templates for concept descriptions differ from templates for operations, etc. More than one data specification template can be defined and used for an element instance. Which templates are used for an element instance is defined via _HasDataSpecification_.

There is one data specification template supporting IEC 61360 [IEC61360-1]:

* _DataSpecificationIec61360:_ defining concept descriptions for both properties and coded values.

_<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360 gives an overview of the data specification template and how it is used in combination with the information model as defined in Part 1 of the document series, namely _DataSpecification_, _DataSpecificationContent,_ and _ConceptDescription_.

[#_Ref129879629]
.Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360
image::image8.png[align=center]

IEC 61360 is a standard that describes how to define the semantics of properties in a data dictionary. Part 1 does not prescribe how to define a concept description; it only supports the definition of concept descriptions. To do so, a data specification template needs to be assigned to the concept description. Which data specification is made available is defined via _HasDataSpecification/dataSpecification_.

The legend for understanding the UML diagrams and the table specification of the classes is explained in _<<#_templates_for_uml_tables,Annex C>>_ and _<<#_legend_for_uml_modelling,Annex D>>_.

|max |Maximum of the value |boolean |1
|===


====
Note: This is how the AAS deals with the following combinations of level types:
====





____
If all attributes are false, the concept is mapped to a Property and level type is ignored.
____


____
If a maximum of one attribute is set to true, the concept is mapped to a Property.
____


____
If min and max are set to true, the concept is mapped to a Range.
____


____
If more than one attribute is set to true, does not include min and max only (see second case), the concept is mapped to a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with the corresponding number of Properties. Example: If the attributes min and nom are set to true, the concept is mapped to a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with two Properties: min and nom. The data type of both Properties is the same.
____

In the cases 2 and 4, the _semanticId_ of the Property or Properties within the _SubmodelElementCollection_ needs to include information about the level type. Otherwise, the semantics is not described in a unique way. In link:#bib27[[27\]], IRDI paths are introduced. However, no rules of how to map IRDI paths to __Reference__s for semanticIds have yet been defined.

It is not recommended to use level type when defining concept descriptions for Properties, except for ranges (i.e. min and max). This is considered to be a deprecated way of defining property sets. See also link:#bib27[[27\]], where one proposal on how to deal with level type is to remove the level type and to define several properties instead.

=== Value List Attributes

"_ValueList_" allows to define an enumeration type for a property. The value list is a set of value reference pairs.

== Mapping IEC 61360 Data Types to XSD Data Types

Using a concept description requires mapping the data type of the concept description to a conformant type in xsd (for example in _Property/valueType_).

Examples for the different IEC 61360 data types can be found here: https://eclass.eu/support/technical-specification/structure-and-elements/value.

== Category of Concept Descriptions 


====
Note: the attribute category of referables was set to deprecated in V3.0 of Part 1. Hence this clause informs about the meaning, in case applications are still using the attribute category.
====


Although the IEC 61360 attributes listed in this template are defined for properties and values only, it is also possible to use the template for other definitions as long as no specific data specifications for concept descriptions for these elements are available. This is shown in _<<#_Toc129695225,Table 2>>_, _<<#_Ref129944411,Table 3>>_ and _<<#_Toc122380240,Table 5>>_.

For the meaning of the content attributes of the IEC 61360 data specification template, please refer to IEC 61360 and/or ECLASS.

The data specification template can be used to describe both properties and values.

See _<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360 on how data specification templates are related to concept descriptions. _<<#_Toc125981069,Figure 12>>_ lists all categories used for concept descriptionsfootnote:[Note: although the possible categories are listed as enumeration, no enumeration has been defined for Referable/category.].

The following tables recommend using specific categories to distinguish which kind of concept is described. They also give advice on which attributes need to be filled for which category of concept description.

== Primitive and Simple Data Types (normative)

=== Predefined Simple Data Types

The metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell [AAS-Part1] uses basic data types as defined in the XML Schema Definition (XSD)footnote:[https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/, formerly https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema]. For an overview of the types used in this document, see _<<#_Toc129695229,Table 6>>_. Their definition is outside the scope of this document.

The meaning and format of xsd types is specified in https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema. The simple type "langString" is specified in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/].

.Primitive DataTypes Used in Metamodel

== Mappings to Data Formats to Share I4.0-Compliant Information (normative)

=== General

Part 1 of the document series introduces the need for different serialization formats and described when which format is used. Part 1 also introduces the implementation guide for embedded data specifications. Hence, only the links to the different schemas derived for the formats XML, JSON, and RDF are provided in the following. Further information can be found in [AAS-Part1].

=== XML

The metamodel of an Asset Administration Shell needs to be serialized for import and export scenarios. XML is a possible serialization format.


====
Note 1: the xml schema (.xsd files) is maintained in the repository "aas-spec" of the github project admin-shell-io link:#bib25[[25\]]: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\xml.
====



====
Note 2: the mapping rules of how to derive the xml schema from the technology-neutral metamodel as defined in this specification can be found here: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\xml\Readme.md#xml-mappingrules.
====



====
Note 3: example files can be found here: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\xml\examples.
====


===  JSON

JSONfootnote:[see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259 or https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm] (JavaScript Object Notation) is a further serialization format that serializes the metamodel of an Assest Administration Shell for import and export scenarios.

Additionally, JSON format is used to describe the payload in the http/REST API for active Asset Administration Shells link:#bib14[[14\]].


====
Note 1: the JSON schema (.json files) is maintained in the repository "aas-spec" of the github project admin-shell-io link:#bib25[[25\]]: h aas-specs-3.0\schemas\json
====



====
Note 2: the mapping rules of how to derive the JSON schema from the technology-neutral metamodel as defined in this specification can be found here: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\json\Readme.md#json-mappingrules
====



====
Note 3: example files can be found here: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\json\examples.
====


===  RDF

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) link:#bib26[[26\]] is the recommended standard of the W3C to unambiguously model and present semantic data. RDF documents are structured in the form of triples, consisting of subjects, relations, and objects. The resulting model is often interpreted as a graph, with the subject and object elements as the nodes and the relations as the graph edges.


====
Note 1: the RDF scheme/OWL files (.ttl files) are maintained in the repository "aas-spec" of the github project admin-shell-io link:#bib25[[25\]]: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\rdf
====

====
Note 3: example files can be found here: aas-specs-3.0\schemas\rdf\examples
====


== Summary and Outlook

This document provides a metamodel for specifying data specification templates for defining concept descriptions for properties and values. These data specification templates are conformant to IEC 61360.

This document is part of the document series "Asset Administration Shell in Detail".

Additional parts of the document series cover (see link:#bib14[[14\]]):

* the information model that is the basis for file exchange and interface payload definition (Part 1),
* a file exchange format AASX (Part 5),
* interfaces and APIs for accessing the information of Asset Administration Shells (access, modify, query, and execute information and active functionality; Part 2),
* security aspects including access control (part 3),
* physical units as used to define the semantics of quantifiable properties in IEC 61360 (Part 3b).

== Background Information

=== General

This clause provides general information about sources of information and relevant concepts for the data specification under consideration, as well as its usage in the context of the Asset Administration Shell. It is not normative.

=== Data Elements (Part 1)

[#_Ref129879578]
.Metamodel of Data Elements (Part 1)
image::image14.png[align=center]

The data specification template IEC61360 is relevant for the definition of concept descriptions for data elements (_<<#_Ref129879578,Figure 13>>_). Submodel Elements inherit from _hasSemantics_, i.e. they have a semanticId and optionally some additional supplementary semantic IDs (_<<#_Ref129879594,Figure 14>>_).

_<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360 gives an overview of the relationship of concept descriptions (_ConceptDescription_) and data specifications (DataSpecification, _DataSpecificationContent_ and _HasDataSpecification_) from Part 1 for this concrete data specification template.

[#_Ref129879594]
.Metamodel of HasSemantics (Part 1)
image::image15.png[align=center]

Clause <<#_category_of_concept_descriptions,8>> describes how to use the data specification template to describe further of the metamodel as specified in Part 1 that may also have semantics assigned to them (by inheriting from HasSemantics): Submodel, all other SubmodelElements, SpecificAssetId, Qualifier, and Extension. In these cases, the preferred name and the definition are mainly used to provide a minimum of information on what the corresponding value is about.

=== Examples

_<<#_Toc129706740,Figure 15>>_ shows an example of a property with idShort "MaxRotationSpeed" with a semantic ID referring to a concept description "MaxRotationSpeed". The concept description shows that MaxRotationSpeed is a quantitative property because the data type is one of *_MEASURE, namely INTEGER_MEASURE. In this case, the definition of a physical unit is mandatory. It is "1/min" for MaxRotationSpeed. A unique ID is also provided for this physical unit. Concept descriptions for physical units are described e.g. in Part 4b of this document series on the Details of the Asset Administration Shell.

The type INTEGER_MEASURE of the concept description is mapped to xs:integer of the property.

[#_Toc129706740]
.Example Quantitative Property MaxRotationSpeed in AASX Package Explorer
image::image16.png[align=center]

_<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ shows a property "CoolingType". Its semanticId references a concept description that defines a value list (_DataSpecificationIec612360/valueList_) with two values BAB657 and BAB611.

[#_Toc129706741]
.Example Property with Enumeration in AASX Package Explorer
image::image17.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc129706742,Figure 17>>_ shows the concept description for the value BAB657 that was used in the enumeration in _<<#_Toc129706741,Figure 16>>_. Most attributes are not relevant (see Clause <<#_category_of_concept_descriptions,8>>). However, it is mandatory to set the attribute _DataSpecificationIec61360/value_, the _preferredName_ (open circuit, external cooling), and the data type (for enumeration, the data type is typically just STRING).

[#_Toc129706742]
.Example Value Concept Description in AASX Package Explorer
image::image18.png[align=center]

=== Referencing (Part 1)

Besides the abstract class _HasSemantics,_ the referencing concept explained in Part 1 is also relevant (type _ReferenceFigure 18_). In the case of the data specification template IEC61360, the only relevant key types are "GlobalReference" and "ConceptDescription". In case the concept description is a shadow copy of an existing data dictionary and uses the same ID, it is recommended to use the Global Reference for the _DataSpecificationIec61360/unitId_ or _ValueReferencePair/valueId_. Otherwise, a model reference with _Key/type_ equal to _ConceptDescription_ is used.

The same applies to _HasSemantics/semanticId_ and semantic IDs in _HasSemantics/supplementalSemanticIds._

== Backus-Naur-Form

The Backus-Naur form (BNF) – a meta-syntax notation for context-free grammars – is used to define grammars. For more information see Wikipediafootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form].

A BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as

*<symbol> ::= __expression__*

where:

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol[symbol]> is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonterminal[nonterminal] (variable) and the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)[__expression__] consists of one or more sequences of either terminal or nonterminal symbols,
* ::= means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right,
* more sequences of symbols are separated by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar[vertical bar] "|", indicating a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_(formal_language_theory)[choice], the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left,
* symbols that never appear on a left side are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_symbol[terminals], while symbols that appear on a left side are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonterminal_symbol[non-terminals] and are always enclosed between the pair of angle brackets <>,
* terminals are enclosed with quotation marks: "text". "" is an empty string,
* optional items are enclosed in square brackets: [<item-x>],
* items existing 0 or more times are enclosed in curly brackets are suffixed with an asterisk (*) such as <word> ::= <letter> \{<letter>}*,
* Items existing 1 or more times are suffixed with an addition (plus) symbol, +, such as <word> ::= \{<letter>}+,
* round brackets are used to explicitly to define the order of expansion to indicate precedence, example: ( <symbol1> | <symbol2> ) <symbol3>,
* text without quotation marks is an informal explanation of what is expected; this text is cursive if grammar is non-recursive and vice versa.

+++Example:+++

*<contact-address> ::= <name> "e-mail addresses:" <e-mail-Addresses>*

*<e-mail-Addresses> ::= \{<e-mail-Address>}**

*<e-mail-Address> ::= <local-part> "@" <domain>*

== Templates for UML Tables

=== General

The templates used for element specification are explained in this annex. For details for the semantics see Legend for UML Modelling.

For capitalization of titles, rules according to https://capitalizemytitle.com/ are used.

=== Template for Classes

Template for Classes:

[width="100%",cols="36%,29%,23%,12%",options="header",]
|===
|*Class:* |<Class Name> [\<<abstract>>] ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] ["\<<Template>>"] | |
|*Explanation:* |<Explanatory text> | |
|*Inherits from:* |\{<Class Name> ";" }+ | "-" | |
|*Attribute* |*Explanation* |*Type* |*Card.*
|<attribute or association name> ["\<<ordered>>"] ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] |<Explanatory text> |<Type> |<Card>
|===

The following stereotypes can be used:

* \<<abstract>>: Class cannot be instantiated but serves as superclass for inheriting classes
* \<<Experimental>>: Class is experimental, i.e. usage is only recommended for experimental purposes because non backward compatible changes may occur in future versions
* \<<Deprecated>>: Class is deprecated, i.e. it is recommended to not use the element any longer; it will be removed in a next major version of the model
* \<<Template>>: Class is a template only, i.e. class is not instantiated but used for additional specification purposes (for details see parts 3 of document series)
* The following kinds of _Types_ are distinguished:
* _Primitive:_ Type is no object type (class) but a data type; it is just a value
* _Class:_ Type is an object type (class); it is realized as composite aggregation (composition), and does not exist independent of its parent
* _Type:_
** _<Class>:_ Type is a class
** _ModelReference<\{Referable}>:_ Type is a Reference with _Reference/type=ModelReference_ and is called model reference; the \{Referable} is to be substituted by any referable element (including _Referable_ itself for the most generic case) – the element that is referred to is denoted in the __Key/type__=<\{Referable}> for the last _Key_ in the model reference; for the graphical representation see _<<#_legend_for_uml_modelling,Annex D>>_, for more information on referencing see _<<#_background_information,Annex A>>_
** _<Primitive>: Type_ is a primitive data type, see Clause <<#_primitive_and_simple_data_types_normative,10>>
** _<Enumeration>:_ Type is an enumeration
* _Card._ is the cardinality (or multiplicity) defining the lower and upper bound of the number of instances of the member element. "*" denotes an arbitrary infinite number of elements of the corresponding Type. "0..1" means optional. "0..*" or "0..3" etc. means that the list may be either not available (null object) or empty.


====
Note: attributes having a default value are always considered to be optional; there is always a value for the attribute because the default value is used for initialization in this case.
====


+++Examples for valid model references+++

If class type equal to "ModelReference<Submodel>", the following reference would be a valid reference (using the text serialization as defined in Part 1:

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*

If class type equal to "ModelReference<Referable>", the following references would be valid references (using the text serialization as defined in part 1:

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)temperature*

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (File)myDocument*

This would be an invalid reference for "ModelReference<Referable>", instead type "Reference" shall be used:

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (File)myDocument (FragmentReference)Hints*

This would be an invalid reference for "ModelReference<Submodel>"

*(Submodel)https://example.com/aas/1/1/1234859590, (Property)temperature*

=== Template for Enumerations

Template for Enumerations:

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|*Enumeration:* |<Enumeration Name> ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"]
|*Explanation:* |
|*Set of:* |\{<Enumeration> ";" }+ | "-"
|*Literal* |*Explanation*

Value of enumeration

|<enumValue2> ["\<<Experimental>>"] ["\<<Deprecated>>"] a|
<Explanatory text>

Value of enumeration, also included in one of the enumerations listed in "Set of:"

|===

"Set Of" lists enumerations that are contained in the enumeration. It is only relevant for validation, making sure that all elements relevant for the enumeration are considered.

Enumeration values use Camel Case notation and start with a small letter. However, there might be exceptions in case of very well-known enumeration values.

=== Handling of Constraints

Constraints are prefixed with *AASc-* followed by the number of the document in the Part 3 series (here "3a"), followed by a three-digit number. The "c" in "AASc-" was motivated by "Concept Description". The numbering of constraints is unique within the namespace AASc; a number of a constraint that was removed will not be used again.


====
Note: in the Annex listing the metamodel changes, constraints with prefix AASs- or AASc- are also listed. These are security or data specification constraints and are now part of the split document Legend for UML Modelling.

== Legend for UML Modelling

=== OMG UML General

This annex explains the UML elements used in this specification. For more information, please refer to the comprehensive literature available for UML. The formal specification can be found in link:#bib12[[12\]].

_<<#_Toc129706744,Figure 19>>_ shows a class with name "Class1" and an attribute with name "attr" of type _Class2_. Attributes are owned by the class. Some of these attributes may represents the end of binary associations, see also _<<#_Ref129879945,Figure 20>>_. In this case, the instance of _Class2_ is navigable via the instance of the owning class _Class1_.footnote:[„Navigability notation was often used in the past according to an informal convention, whereby non-navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the Association whereas navigable ends were assumed to be owned by the Classifier at the opposite end. This convention is now deprecated. Aggregation type, navigability, and end ownership are separate concepts, each with their own explicit notation. Association ends owned by classes are always navigable, while those owned by associations may be navigable or not. link:#bib12[[12\]]”]

[#_Toc129706744]
.Class
image::image20.png[align=center]

_<<#_Ref129879945,Figure 20>>_ shows that _Class4_ inherits all member elements from _Class3_. Or in other word, _Class3_ is a generalization of _Class4, Class4_ is a specialization of _Class3_. This means that each instance of _Class4_ is also an instance of _Class3_. An instance of _Class4_ has the attributes _attr1_ and _attr2,_ whereas instances of _Class3_ only have the attribute _attr1_.

[#_Ref129879945]
.Inheritance/Generalization
image::image21.png[align=center]

_<<#_Ref129879956,Figure 21>>_ defines the required and allowed multiplicity/cardinality within an association between instances of _Class1_ and _Class2_. In this example, an instance of _Class2_ is always related to exactly one instance of _Class1_. An instance of _Class1_ is either related to none, one, or more (unlimited, i.e. no constraint on the upper bound) instances of _Class2_. The relationship can change over time.

Multiplicity constraints can also be added to attributes and aggregations.

The notation of multiplicity is as follows:

<lower-bound>.. <upper-bound>

where <lower-bound> is a value specification of type Integer - i.e. 0, 1, 2, … - and <upper-bound> is a value specification of type UnlimitedNatural. The star character (*) is used to denote an unlimited upper bound.

The default is 1 for lower-bound and upper-bound.

[#_Ref129879956]
.Multiplicity
image::image22.png[align=center]

A multiplicity element represents a collection of values. The default is a set, i.e. it is not ordered and the elements within the collection are unique and contain no duplicates. _<<#_Toc129706747,Figure 22>>_ shows an ordered collection: the instances of _Class2_ related to an instance of _Class1_. The stereotype \<<ordered>> is used to denote that the relationship is ordered.

[#_Toc129706747]
.Ordered Multiplicity
image::image23.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc125981080,Figure 23>>_ shows that the member ends of an association can be named as well, i.e. an instance of _Class1_ can be in relationship "relation" to an instance of _Class2_. Vice versa, the instance of _Class2_ is in relationship "reverseRelation" to the instance of _Class1_.

[#_Toc125981080]
.Association
image::image23.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc129706749,Figure 24>>_ shows a composition, also called a composite aggregation. A composition is a binary association, grouping a set of instances. The individuals in the set are typed as specified by _Class2_. The multiplicity of instances of _Class2_ to _Class1_ is always 1 (i.e. upper-bound and lower-bound have value "1"). One instance of _Class2_ belongs to exactly one instance of _Class1_. There is no instance of _Class2_ without a relationship to an instance of _Class1_. _<<#_Ref125977761,Figure 25>>_ shows the composition using an association relationship with a filled diamond as composition adornment.

[#_Toc129706749]
.Composition (Composite Aggregation)
image::image24.png[align=center]

_<<#_Ref125977761,Figure 25>>_ shows an aggregation. An aggregation is a binary association. In contrast to a composition, an instance of _Class2_ can be shared by several instances of _Class1_. _<<#_Ref125977761,Figure 25>>_ shows the shared aggregation using an association relationship with a hallow diamond as aggregation adornment.

[#_Ref125977761]
.Aggregation
image::image25.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc125981083,Figure 26>>_ illustrates that the attribute notation can be used for an association end owned by a class. In this example, the attribute name is "attr" and the elements of this attribute are typed with _Class2._ The multiplicity, here "0..*", is added in square brackets. If the aggregation is ordered, it is added in curly brackets like in this example.

_<<#_Toc129706752,Figure 27>>_ shows a class with three attributes with primitive types and default values. When a property with a default value is instantiated in the absence of a specific setting for the property, the default value is evaluated to provide the initial values of the property.

_<<#_Toc129706753,Figure 28>>_ shows that there is a dependency relationship between _Class1_ and _Class2_. In this case, the dependency means that _Class1_ depends on _Class2_ because the type of attribute _attr_ depends on the specification of class _Class2._ A dependency is depicted as dashed arrow between two model elements.

=== UML Naming Rules

The following rules are used for naming of classes, attributes etc.:

* all names use CamelCase; for exceptions see rules for Enumeration values,
* class names always start with a capital letter,
* attribute names always start with a small letter,
* primitive types start with a capital letter; exception: predefined types of XSD like string,
* enumerations start with a capital letter,
* names of member ends of an association start with a capital letter,
* all stereotypes specific to the Asset Administration Shell specification start with a capital letter, e.g. "\<<Deprecated>>"; predefined stereotypes in UML start with a small letter, e.g. "\<<abstract>>" or "\<<enumeration>>".

In UML, the convention is to name associations and aggregations in singular form. The multiplicity is to be taken into account to decide on whether there are none, a single, or several elements in the corresponding association or aggregation.


====
Note: a plural form of the name of attributes with cardinality >=1 may be needed in some serializations (e.g. in JSON). In this case, it is recommended to add an "s". In case of resulting incorrect English (e.g. isCaseOf isCaseOfs), it must be decided whether or not to support such exceptions.
====


=== Notes to Graphical UML Representation

Specific graphical modelling rules, which are used in this specification but not included in this form, are explained below link:#bib12[[12\]].

_<<#_Ref125545521,Figure 37>>_ different graphical representations of a composition (composite aggregation). In Variant A, a relationship with a filled aggregation diamond is used. In Variant B, an attribute with the same semantics is defined. And in Variant C, the implicitly assumed default name of the attribute in Variant A is explicitly stated. This document uses notation B.

It is assumed that only the end member of the association is navigable per default, i.e. it is possible to navigate from an instance of _Class1_ to the owned instance of _Class2_ but not vice versa. If there is no name for the end member of the association given, it is assumed that the name is identical to the class name but starting with a small letter – compared to Variant C.

_Class2_ instance only exists if the parent object of type _Class1_ exists.

[#_Ref125545521]
.Graphical Representations of Composite Aggregation/Composition
image::image37.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc129706763,Figure 38>>_ shows different representations of a shared aggregation: a _Class2_ instance can exist independently of a _Class1_ instance; it only references the instances of _Class2_. Now an attribute with the same semantics is defined In Variant B. The reference is denoted by a star added after the type of the attribute.

It is assumed that only the end member of the aggregation association is navigable per default, i.e. it is possible to navigate from an instance of _Class1_ to the owned instance of _Class2_ but not vice versa. Otherwise, variant B would not be identical to Variant A.

A specialty in _<<#_Toc129706763,Figure 38>>_ is that the aggregated instances are referables in the sense of the Asset Administration Shell metamodel (i.e. they inherit from the predefined abstract class "Referable"). This is why Variant B is identical to Variant A. This would not be the case for non-referable elements in the metamodel. The structure of a reference to a model element of the Asset Administration Shell is explicitly defined. A model reference consists of an ordered list of keys. The last key in the key chain shall reference an instance of type _Class2_ (i.e. Reference/type equal to "Class2").

[#_Toc129706763]
.Graphical Representation of Shared Aggregation
image::image38.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc129706764,Figure 39>>_ show different graphical representations of generalization. Variant A is the classical graphical representation as defined in link:#bib12[[12\]]. Variant B is a short form, if _Class1_ is not on the same diagram. The name of the class that _Class3_ is inheriting from is depicted in the upper right corner.

Variant C not only shows which class Class3 instances are inheriting from, but also what they are inheriting. This is depicted by the class name it is inheriting from, followed by "::" and then the list of all inherited elements – here attribute _class2_. Typically, the inherited elements are not shown.

[#_Toc129706764]
.Graphical Representation of Generalization/Inheritance
image::image39.png[align=center]

_<<#_Toc129706765,Figure 40>>_ depicts different graphical notations for enumerations in combination with inheritance. In Variant A, "Enumeration1" additionally contains the literals as defined by "Enumeration2".

====
Note: the direction of inheritance is opposite to the one for class inheritance. This can be seen in Variant C that defines the same enumerations but without inheritance. In Variant B, another graphical notation visualizes which literals are inherited by which enumeration. Since the literals within an enumeration are ordered, the order of classes it is inheriting from is important.

== Metamodel Changes

=== General

This Annex lists the changes from version to version of the metamodel together with major changes in the overall document. Non-backward compatible changes (nc) are marked as such.

nc="x" means not backward compatible, if no value is added in the table, the change is backward compatible.

nc="(x)" means that the change made was implicitly contained or stated in the document before and is now being formalized. Therefore, the change is considered to be backward compatible.

Changes for the data specification templates of the metamodel are listed in separate tables each.

Each subclause consists of three parts:


. changes w.r.t. previous version,
. new elements in metamodel w.r..t previous version,
. new, changed, or removed Constraints w.r.t previous version.


====
Note: before V3.0RC03, the security metamodel was also part of this document. Therefore, security metamodel changes were also listed using the three subclauses as described above.
====


=== Changes V3.0 vs. Part 1 V2.0.1

Major Changes:

* CHANGE: was part of part 1 in former versions of the document series until V3.0RC02

* NEW: Clause "Normative References" in Preamble
* NEW: SpecificAssetId added to table with categories of concept descriptions
* NEW: constraints added for applying categories to concept descriptions
* UPDATE: data mappings IEC 61360 to xsd data types as used in part 1
* CHANGE: no IEC 61360 data type RATIONAL_* allowed any longer for RANGE; instead, INTEGER_* is used
* CHANGE: all IEC 61360 data types allowed for Property, except STRING_TRANSLATABLE, IRI, IRDI, HTML, FILE, BLOB (before only STRING_TRANSLATABLE was excluded)
* CHANGE: LevelType changed from Enumeration to Class, Table added
* CHANGE: Names containing IEC renamed to camel case using Iec, e.g. DataSpecificationIEC61360
