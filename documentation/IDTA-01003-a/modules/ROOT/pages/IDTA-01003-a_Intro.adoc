===  Editorial Notes

This document "Specification of the Asset Administration Shell - Part 3a: Data Specification IEC61360", version 3.1 was produced from December 2022 to April 2024 by the Work Stream "Specifications of the Asset Administration Shell" of the Working Group "Open Technology" of the https://industrialdigitaltwin.org[Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA)]. It has the number IDTA-01003-a-3-1.

A bugfix version V3.0.1 was published in April 2024.

The document "Details of the Asset Administration Shell – Part 1 – The exchange of information between partners in the value chain of Industie 4.0, V3.0RC02" was split into several parts. One of them is this document, which represents Part 3a and describes a data specification that is defined to be used with the core model as specified in Part 1. This is also why versioning now starts with V3.0: it is only valid in combination with V3.0 of Part 1.

This document, version 3.0, was produced from June 2022 to November 2022 by the sub working group "Asset Administration Shell" of the joint working group of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 working group "Reference Architectures, Standards and Norms" and the "Open Technology" working group of the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA). It is the first release published by the IDTA. It has the number IDTA-01003-a-3-0.

For a complete history, please refer to Part 1 of the https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications[document series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell"].

For better readability, the abbreviation "I4.0" is consistently used for "Industrie 4.0" in compound terms. The term "Industrie 4.0" continues to be used when standing on its own.

This specification is versioned using https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (semver) and follows the semver specification link:#bib13[[13\]].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14[BCP 14] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC2119] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174[RFC8174footnote:[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]]:


. MUST This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
. MUST NOT This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
. SHOULD This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
. MAY This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein, an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)




===  Scope of This Document

The Asset Administration Shell (see Part 1 of the document series) allows to define data specification templates. Data specification templates aim to enable interoperability between the partners that agree on the template. A template defines a set of attributes, with each attribute having a clear semantics. This set of attributes corresponds to a (sub-)schema.

This document specifies data specification templates conformant to IEC 61360. IEC 61360 specifies how to define the semantics of single properties or values. The value range of a property can be defined as a value list – an enumeration -, while each of the (coded) values of the value list are treated as single concepts. They are thus suited to be used as data specifications for concept descriptions.

This document assumes familiarity with the concept and specification of the Asset Administration Shell as defined in Part 1.

The main stakeholders addressed in this document are architects and software developers aiming to implement a digital twin using the Asset Administration Shell in an interoperable way. Additionally, the content can also be used as input for discussions with international standardization organizations and further collaborations.

Please consult the continuously updated reading guide link:#bib15[[15\]] for an overview of documents on the Asset Administration Shell. The reading guide gives advice on which documents should be read depending on the role of the reader.

===  Working Principles

The work is based on the following principle: keep it simple but do not simplify if it affects interoperability.

The partners represented in the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA), as well as in the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and associations such as ZVEI, VDMA, VDI/ VDE and Bitkom, ensure that there is broad sectoral coverage of process, hybrid, and factory automation and in terms of integrating information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT).

Design alternatives were intensively discussed within the working group. An extensive feedback process of this document series is additionally performed within the working groups of Plattform Industrie 4.0 and IDTA.

Guiding principle for the specification was to provide detailed information, which can be easily implemented also by small and medium-sized enterprises.

==  Introduction

This document is part of the series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell" that provide the specifications for interoperable usage of the Asset Administration Shell.

This part of the series extends Part 1 and defines a technology-neutral specification of data specification templates, enabling the description of concept descriptions conformant to IEC 61360 in UML. This UML meta model serves as the basis for deriving several different formats for exchanging Asset Administration Shells, e.g. for XML, JSON, RDF, AutomationML, and OPC UA information models.

_<<#_Toc129706725,Figure 1>>_ shows the different ways of exchanging information via Asset Administration Shells. This part of the "Asset Administration Shell in Detail" series is the basis for all of these types of information exchange.

File exchange (1) is described in Part 5 of this document series.

The API (2) is specified in Part 2 of the document series "Details of the Asset Administration Shell" link:#bib14[[14\]]. It also includes access to concept descriptions using the data specifications as specified in this document.

The I4.0 language (3) is based on the information metamodel specified in Part 1 and 3 link:#bib23[[23\]].

Part 3 is not a single document. Instead, it is an own series of documents, each featuring a specific use case that is supported by the specified data specification templates.

== General

=== Introduction

IEC 61360 is a standard that describes how to define the semantics of properties in a data dictionary. The known data dictionaries ECLASS and IEC CDD are based on this standard. The data specification templates specified in this document make it possible to directly use concept descriptions as standardized in these data dictionaries. Additionally, concept descriptions, which do not (yet) exist in these data dictionaries, can be defined using the same schema.

Concept descriptions, whether defined externally in existing data dictionaries or internally as part of the Asset Administration Shell environment, are the foundation for defining submodel templates link:#bib24[[24\]] link:#bib16[[16\]].

IEC 61360-1:2017 is largely compliant to IEC 61360-2:2012 and ISO 3584-42:2010.


====
Note: for details on how to use the data specifications and for further explanations, please refer directly to IEC 61360.

The following subclauses show some examples from these existing data dictionaries to ease understanding of the data specification templates.

=== Concept Descriptions for Properties and Values 

The data specification template IEC 61360 introduces additional attributes to define the semantics – i.e. a concept description – of a property or a value based on IEC 61360.

IEC 61360 requests to use IRDIs for the identification of a concept. The Asset Administration Shell allows to use other identifiers besides IRDI. The IRDI, the unique identifier of an IEC 61360 property or value, maps to ConceptDescription/id.

_<<#_Toc129706726,Figure 2>>_ to _<<#_Toc129706729,Figure 5>>_ show examples from ECLASS _<<#_Toc129706727,Figure 3>>_ shows a property with enumeration type. One of the values in this enumeration is shown in _<<#_Toc129706728,Figure 4>>_, each value has its own unique ID. The unique identifier of a value ( _<<#_Toc129706728,Figure 4>>_) is also used for _Property/valueId._

_<<#_Ref129950722,Figure 6>>_ Example for Property with Level Type from IEC CDD shows an example from IEC CDD for a concept description of a _Property_ with usage of Level Type (in this example level type MIN, MAX and NOM, see data type). This is a short form of defining a collection of three properties with the same data type and semantics except for the level.

== Predefined Data Specification Templates 

=== Overview

A data specification template specifies which additional attributes shall be added to an element instance that are not part of the meta model. Typically, data specification templates have a specific scope. For example, templates for concept descriptions differ from templates for operations, etc. More than one data specification template can be defined and used for an element instance. Which templates are used for an element instance is defined via _HasDataSpecification_.

There is one data specification template supporting IEC 61360 [IEC61360-1]:

* _DataSpecificationIec61360:_ defining concept descriptions for both properties and coded values.

_<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360 gives an overview of the data specification template and how it is used in combination with the information model as defined in Part 1 of the document series, namely _DataSpecification_, _DataSpecificationContent,_ and _ConceptDescription_.

[#_Ref129879629]
.Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360
image::image8.png[align=center]

IEC 61360 is a standard that describes how to define the semantics of properties in a data dictionary. Part 1 does not prescribe how to define a concept description; it only supports the definition of concept descriptions. To do so, a data specification template needs to be assigned to the concept description. Which data specification is made available is defined via _HasDataSpecification/dataSpecification_.

The legend for understanding the UML diagrams and the table specification of the classes is explained in _<<#_templates_for_uml_tables,Annex C>>_ and _<<#_legend_for_uml_modelling,Annex D>>_.
