= Handling of Constraints

Constraints are prefixed with *AASc-3a-* followed by a three-digit number. The "c" in "AASc-" was motivated by "Concept Description". The numbering of constraints is unique within namespace AASc-3a; a number of a constraint that was removed will not be used again.


====
Note: in the Annex listing the metamodel changes, constraints with prefix AASd-, AASs- or AASc- are also listed. These are metamodel, security or data specification constraints, and are now part of the split document parts.
