|===


The ID of the data specification template was derived conformant to the rules for semantic IDs for data specifications as defined in Part 1 of the document series, IDTA-01001-3-1. 


This ID will be used in _hasDataSpecification/dataSpecification_.

This namespace has the qualifier "IEC:" Examples: `IEC:DataSpecificationIec61360/preferredName` or `IEC:DataSpecificationIec61360/levelType/min` or `IEC:LevelType/min`

Content of data specification template for concept descriptions for properties, values, and value lists conformant to IEC 61360.

Note: for details, please refer to [IEC61360-1], property, value_list and term
====

////
+++Constraint AASc-010+++: If _DataSpecificationIec61360/value_ is not empty, _DataSpecificationIec61360/valueList_ shall be empty, and vice versa.
////

====
Note 1: it is also possible that both _DataSpecificationIec61360/value_ and _SpecificationIec61360/valueList_ are empty. This is the case for concept descriptions that define the semantics of a property but do not have an enumeration (_valueList)_ as data type.
====



====
Note 2: although it is possible to define a concept description for a value list, it is not possible to reuse this value list. It is only possible to directly add a value list as data type to a specific semantic definition of a property.
====

e|INTEGER_COUNT a|
values containing values of the type INTEGER, but which are no currencies or measures

====


e|IRDI a|
values conforming to ISO/IEC 11179 series global identifier sequences


====
Note 1: for details, please refer to [IEC61360-1], specific STRING_TYPE, the IRDI_STRING.

Note 4: ISO29002_IRDI values are values containing a global identifier that identifies an administrated item in a registry. The structure of this identifier complies with the identifier syntax defined in ISO/TS 29002-5. The identifier shall fulfil the requirements specified in ISO/TS 29002-5 for an “international registration data identifier” (IRDI).

e|BLOB a|
values containing the content of a file. Values may be binaries.

_HTML conformant to HTML5_ is a special blob.

In IEC61360, _binary_ is a sequence of bits, each bit being represented by "0" and "1" only. A binary is a blob. However, a blob may also contain other source code.

e|nom a|Nominal value (value as designated) |boolean |1
e|typ a|Value as typically present |boolean |1
e|max e|Maximum of the value |boolean |1
|===


====
Note: This is how the AAS deals with the following combinations of level types:
====


* Case 1: If all attributes are false, the concept is mapped to a Property and level type is ignored.

* Case2: If a maximum of one attribute is set to true, the concept is mapped to a Property.

* Case 3: If min and max are set to true, the concept is mapped to a Range.


* Case 4: If more than one attribute is set to true, does not include min and max only (see second case), the concept is mapped to a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with the corresponding number of Properties. Example: If the attributes min and nom are set to true, the concept is mapped to a _SubmodelElementCollection_ with two Properties: min and nom. The data type of both Properties is the same.


In the cases 2 and 4, the _semanticId_ of the Property or Properties within the _SubmodelElementCollection_ needs to include information about the level type. Otherwise, the semantics is not described in a unique way. In link:#bib27[[27\]], IRDI paths are introducedfootnote:[see also https://eclass.eu/support/technical-specification/data-model/irdi-path]. 


It is not recommended to use level type when defining concept descriptions for Properties, except for ranges (i.e. min and max). This is considered to be a deprecated way of defining property sets. See also link:#bib27[[27\]], where one proposal on how to deal with level type is to remove the level type and to define several properties instead.

=== Value List Attributes

"_ValueList_" allows to define an enumeration type for a property. The value list is a set of value reference pairs.

== Mapping IEC 61360 Data Types to XSD Data Types

Using a concept description requires mapping the data type of the concept description to a conformant type in xsd (for example in _Property/valueType_).

Examples for the different IEC 61360 data types can be found here: https://eclass.eu/support/technical-specification/structure-and-elements/value.

== Category of Concept Descriptions 


====
Note: the attribute category of referables was set to deprecated in V3.0 of Part 1. Hence, this clause informs about the meaning, in case applications are still using the attribute category.
====


Although the IEC 61360 attributes listed in this template are defined for properties and values only, it is also possible to use the template for other definitions as long as no specific data specifications for concept descriptions for these elements are available. This is shown in _<<#_Toc129695225,Table 2>>_, _<<#_Ref129944411,Table 3>>_ and _<<#_Toc122380240,Table 5>>_.

For the meaning of the content attributes of the IEC 61360 data specification template, please refer to IEC 61360 and/or ECLASS.

The data specification template can be used to describe both properties and values.

See _<<#_Ref129879629,Figure 7>>_ Overview Relationship Metamodel Part 1 a & Data Specifications IEC 61360 on how data specification templates are related to concept descriptions. _<<#_Toc125981069,Figure 12>>_ lists all categories used for concept descriptionsfootnote:[Note: although the possible categories are listed as enumeration, no enumeration has been defined for Referable/category.].

The following tables recommend using specific categories to distinguish which kind of concept is described. They also give advice on which attributes need to be filled for which category of concept description.

== Cross-Constraints and Invariants for Predefined Data Specifications (normative)

=== General

This clause documents constraints in the context of the predefined data specifications that cannot be assigned to a single class, i.e. that are no class invariants.

https://sunye.github.io/ocl/[A class invariant is a constraint that must be true for all instances of a class at any time.]

Note: these constraints include elements of Part 1 Metamodel, IDTA-01001.

== Primitive and Simple Data Types (normative)

=== Predefined Simple Data Types

The metamodel of the Asset Administration Shell uses some of the predefined simple data types of the  link:https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/[XML Schema Definition] (XSD) 
as its basic data types footnote:[https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/, former https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema]. For an overview of the types used in this document, see _<<#_Toc129695229,Table 6>>_. Their definition is outside the scope of this document.

The meaning and format of xsd types is specified in https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema. The simple type "langString" is specified in the Resource Description Framework (RDF)footnote:[see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/].

Simple data types start with a small letter.

== Mappings to Data Formats to Share I4.0-Compliant Information (normative)

=== General

Part 1 of this document series (IDTA-01001) introduces different serialization formats: XML, JSON and RDF. 
Part 1 also introduces the implementation guide for embedded data specifications. 
This is why the different formats are described in IDTA-01001.
